abstract:  "In Progress... We give the first local characterization of safe paths for flow decompositions in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), leading to a practical algorithm for finding the complete set of safe paths. We additionally evaluated our algorithms against the trivial safe algorithms (unitigs, extended unitigs) and the popularly used heuristic (greedy-width) for flow decomposition on RNA transcripts datasets. We find that despite maintaining perfect precision the safe and complete algorithm reports significantly higher coverage as compared to trivial safe algorithms."
